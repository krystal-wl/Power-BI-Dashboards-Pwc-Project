## Task 1

### Background
* **Problem**: The manager at PhoneNow (a big telecom company) is seeking transparency and insight into the Call Center dataset to gain an accurate overview of long-term customer and agent behavior trends.
* **Objective**: The purpose of this analysis is to create a dashboard in Power BI for Call Center Manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics.
* **Data Source**: Call center datasets

**Findings:**
* **Important KPIs**:
  * The total number of customers is 7,043, with a churn rate of about 26.5%. This means that over a quarter of customers are leaving.
  * The volume of tech and admin tickets is 2,955 and 3,632, respectively. The total monthly and yearly charges are 0.5M and 16.1M. 
* **Internet Service**:
  * The highest churn (around 42%) is among Fiber‐optic customers, whereas DSL churn is only about 19%, and customers without Internet service are at about 7%.
  * Fiber‐optic accounts for the largest share of Monthly Charges (>60%), so losses in this segment have a major revenue impact.
* **Contract Types & Churn**:
  * Month‐to‐month plans have a significantly higher churn rate (~40%), whereas one‐year and two‐year plans have markedly lower churn (~20% or below).
  * This suggests that longer contracts help retain customers.
* **Year of Contract**:
  * Churn is highest among new customers for under one-year subscription. After the first year, churn steadily decreases over years 2–5.
  * The Monthly Charges are quite high for first‐year subscribers, then decreases through the middle‐contract years (2–4), and rises again at the 5+ or 6+ years.
* **Payment Methods & Churn**: Customers paying by electronic check shows the highest churn(about 40%). In contrast, churn with other payment methods (credit card, bank transfer, and mailed checks) is lower, often below 25%.

Overall, the data suggests that Fiber‐optic, month‐to‐month customers paying by electronic check are at highest risk of canceling. Longer‐term contracts and other payment methods are associated with lower churn.


### 2) Churn Dashboard

**Findings:**

* The Churn Dashboard highlights key factors driving customer churn. Churn is highest among new customers (29.38%) and remains significant even for long-term subscribers (21.06%). Senior citizens (25.5%) and partners (35.8%) also have notable churn rates.
* Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn (55.02%), while longer contracts reduce attrition. Electronic check users (33.58%) experience the highest churn among payment methods. Fiber optic customers have the highest churn rate (41.9%), suggesting possible service issues or competition.
* Retention efforts should focus on new customers, fiber optic users, and month-to-month subscribers. Encouraging longer contracts, improving early customer engagement, and promoting underutilized services like tech support and online security could help reduce churn.

Key Insights & Recommendations:
  * Reduce churn among new customers by improving onboarding and early engagement.
  * Encourage longer contracts, as churn is significantly lower in 1-year and 2-year contracts.
  * Monitor electronic check users as they have the highest churn rate—potentially.
  * Investigate Fiber Optic churn to understand if it’s driven by service issues or competitive offers.
  * Promote underutilized services like Tech Support & Online Security, which could improve retention.
